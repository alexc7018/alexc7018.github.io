I've published my first book, [_The Adventure Atlas!_][book-link]

This book is an experiment. I wanted to create a fantasy RPG campaign-in-a-book, and maps are where I always start when building a new world or story for my campaigns. I generated maps using the incredible tools at [watabou.itch.io](https://watabou.itch.io), finding maps that could go together (towns the right size, roads and rivers and coasts in the right place) and put them all in a book.

There are eight regions, each with 1-3 settlements and a few special locations (forest clearings, buildings, caves, or dungeons). I originally designed this book for my personal use to run a Maze Rats campaign for my son. As it came together, I wondered if other people would want it too.

If you're interested, [a digital copy is only $1][book-link], and it includes PDFs in several formats:

* Maps only, intended for digital use
* Maps alongside notes on 8.5x11" paper
* Printable booklets - one for each region - with notes to either side (for both left- or right-handed writers)

If you've purchased it already, please [leave a review][book-link] if you can - I appreciate any feedback that can help me improve the product.

It's generated enough interest so far that I'm already working on a second edition with hand-drawn original maps. Stay tuned for progress updates!
